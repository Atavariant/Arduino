dump for AD's Arduino shorts
You should have the libraries installed already, but if not, give me a bell and I'll guide you through it. 

The servo behaviours are mapped in the comments - you will need to grab/log your own IR codes. The code gives you the ability to pick 10 setpoints and also to control movement manually - this is the one we looked at originally, just managed to get it working. Only an the Uno so far, but will test with the feather and see if it works.
